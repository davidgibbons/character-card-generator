# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research recommends Context + useReducer over Zustand for state management (4 state domains, no cross-cutting subscriptions). Requirements specify Zustand (STATE-01..04) -- resolve during Phase 2 planning.
- Research recommends phased big-bang rewrite (not incremental migration) due to window-global architecture incompatibility with ES modules.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- png-chunks libraries (2018-2019 vintage) may need ESM compatibility wrapper -- validate during Phase 1 service layer work
- Vite 8 requires Node.js 20.19+ -- Docker base image must be node:22-alpine (captured in BUILD-06)
